#+title: NixOS Grub Themes

This is a flake of Grub themes to use with NixOS. Each of the directories in [[file:themes/][themes]] gives a theme which is usable.

It is simple to add themes to this flake! Just add a directory to themes and put a =default.nix= file in there. Feel free to submit a pull request to add themes.

To use one, set the =boot.loader.grub.theme= option in your NixOS configuration to the desired derivation generated by this flake.

** Installation with NixOS:

First you will have to add this repo to your =flake.nix= file as a new input.

#+begin_src nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "NixOS configuration";

  inputs = {
    ...
    # Add nixos-grub-themes to your inputs ...
    nixos-grub-themes.url = "github:jeslie0/nixos-grub-themes";
  };

  outputs = inputs@{ nixpkgs, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      my_host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        specialArgs = { inherit inputs; };  # pass the inputs into the configuration module
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

After that, you can configure the theme as shown below. In this example it is inside the =configuration.nix= file but it can be any file you choose.
#+begin_src nix
# configuration.nix
{ inputs, config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  boot.loader.grub = {
    ...  # your existing config
    theme = inputs.nixos-grub-themes.packages.${pkgs.system}.nixos;
  };
}
#+end_src
