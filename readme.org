#+title: NixOS Grub Themes

This is a flake of Grub themes to use with NixOS. Each of the directories in [[file:themes/][themes]] gives a theme which is usable.

It is simple to add themes to this flake! Just add a directory to themes and put a =default.nix= file in there. Feel free to submit a pull request to add themes.

To use one, set the =boot.loader.grub.theme= option in your NixOS configuration to the desired derivation generated by this flake.
